## 💡 Executive Summary
Maintaining an active professional presence requires immense manual labor. This project is a hands-free, autonomous Python pipeline that authenticates, navigates, and formulates scheduled posts incorporating heavy PDF media structures.

By tying together **Data Serialization**, **Session Caching/Tokenization**, and **Python Scripting**, this acts as a fully autonomous digital avatar ensuring sustained networking trajectory throughout the week.

## ⚡ Core Engineering Details
> *Merging automation scripts into a robust, fault-tolerant execution model.*

- **Headless Logic & API Hooking:** Utilizes advanced browser scraping or direct API session emulation via `get_token.py` to interact with dynamic web elements safely.
- **Complex Media Handling:** Contains highly dynamic scheduling architecture (`schedule.json`) that processes large internal PDF rendering (`pdfs/`) sequentially based on calendar logic.
- **Exception Resilience:** Social media ecosystems change rapidly. The `post_to_linkedin.py` layers utilize `try-catch` structures to auto-recover from stale network paints without crashing the primary loop.
- **Data Encapsulation:** Employs strictly isolated configurations so tokens and sensitive schedule mapping do not bleed into the functional executing logic.

## 🛠️ The System Layer
| Layer | Technologies used | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Logic/Hooks** | `Python 3` | Acts as the primary driver executing core workflows and reading system storage files. |
| **Authentication Logic** | `Tokenizers`| Safely scrapes or stores required authentication logic avoiding rigid hard-coding constraints. |
| **Schedule Control**| `JSON Management` | Drives asynchronous scheduling allowing the script to know "what" to post and "when". |

  <br/>
  
  1. **Clone the Infrastructure**
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Shubh2-0/linkedin-ai-automation.git
     ```
  2. **Provide Protected Keys & PDFs**
     Execute `get_token.py` or manually map your access token so the script assumes your persona securely. Ensure target PDFs reside inside the correct folder map.
  3. **Trigger the Pipeline**
     ```bash
     python post_to_linkedin.py
     ```
